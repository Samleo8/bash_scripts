# Bash Scripts
Collection of bash scripts for various things like setups and installations.

## Creating start scripts
To get the start scripts working, the `.desktop` files need to be moved to the `~/.config/autostart/` folder. Might only work on Manjaro.

See [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Autostart) for more details.
